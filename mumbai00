Mumbai, originally known as Bombay, has a rich and varied history that spans thousands of years. It was initially inhabited by indigenous groups and was later ruled by the Mauryas and the Guptas. In the 16th century, the Portuguese colonized the islands, and in 1661, Bombay was ceded to the British as part of a dowry for Catherine of Braganza, the Portuguese princess who married King Charles II. Under British rule, Bombay developed into a major port and commercial hub, becoming a key center for trade, particularly during the industrial revolution in the 19th century. The city saw the rise of India's textile industry and a vibrant culture, with diverse communities, including Parsis, Jews, and various migrant groups, contributing to its cosmopolitan identity. Mumbai played a crucial role in India’s independence movement and was home to major political and social events. Post-independence, the city continued to grow rapidly and became the financial, commercial, and entertainment capital of India, known for its thriving Bollywood industry and economic dynamism. Today, Mumbai is a global city that reflects India’s diversity, economic power, and cultural influence, despite facing challenges such as overcrowding and inequality.
